# Vehicle-Dataset-Data-Analysis
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a car dealership dataset to derive meaningful insights. The dataset includes features such as car make, year, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and ownership history. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical exploration, visualizations, and machine learning applications to understand trends in car pricing and ownership.

Features of the Project

Data Exploration

Displaying basic statistical information such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max values.

Identifying data distribution patterns (e.g., normal, skewed) for selected numerical features.

Providing visualizations such as histograms and box plots for better insights.

Data Visualization

Histogram for numerical features to show distribution.

Scatter plots to identify relationships between key numerical variables.

Box plots to display variations in selling price based on categorical variables.

Data Manipulation

Filtering data based on specific conditions, such as first-owner cars with a selling price greater than 500,000.

Grouping data based on categorical features and computing summary statistics.

Selective visualization of manipulated data.

Machine Learning Implementation

Experimenting with regression and classification models to predict car prices or ownership categories.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Reporting performance metrics for model comparison.

Requirements

To run the analysis, install the necessary dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

Running the Notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Load the Vehicle_Dataset.ipynb file and execute the cells sequentially.

Output & Insights

Trends in car pricing based on fuel type, transmission, and ownership history.

Understanding which factors influence car prices the most.

Predictions for car prices using machine learning models.
